            The rainbow lorikeet is a medium-sized parrot. The head is dark green with a yellow-green
            neck, the rest of
            the upper part (wings, back and tail) is dark green. The chest is red with dark blue stripes. The abdomen is
            dark green, and the thighs and rump are yellow with dark green markings. In flight, the yellow wing bar
            contrasts sharply with the red underwing.

        <div>There is little clear distinction between the sexes; however, to a keen observer of their
            colors and
            behavior, their dimorphism is easily discernible.</div>
